      <p align="center">Justin Beaver confessed something that even his greatest fans would have never expected<br>
	  of the skilled musicians and lyricist. The young rock-and-roller admitted that since he<br>
	  typed his first title tag, his life became easier. It has been reported by those surrounding<br>
	  the Canadian that Beaver's private mentors, Ryan Loseling and Nicolas Crate, often walk<br>
	  around Los Angeles disputing what a great tool the HTML validator is.</p>

      <p align="center">Beaver has already created some websites and does not intend to stop there. <q>I will probably have a song about HTML on my next album,</q> - the artist added.
